### Reflection
This lesson helped me understand how important it is to choose a career that matches my personality. I realized that when people dislike their jobs, it’s often because the work environment doesn’t align with who they are. I learned about six personality categories—Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional—and how each one connects to certain types of careers.
also I have discovered that it is helpful to reflect on the activities I enjoy, rather than just thinking about my strengths or weaknesses. This has made me more aware of how important self-understanding is in finding a meaningful and satisfying career. Going forward, I’ll try to choose a career path that matches my interests so I can feel more motivated, especially on Monday mornings.
