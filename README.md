### Reflection on WIL Using STAR Method

**Situation:**  
During my WIL placement, I was assigned to a project where I had to create a web application. I attended classes every day from Monday to Friday, 8 AM to 4 PM, and participated in daily stand-up meetings with the project manager.

**Task:**  
My task was to design and develop a complete web application independently, including creating interfaces, building prototypes, and following all the steps required to make a functional website.

**Action:**  
I attended the daily stand-up meetings, designed user-friendly interfaces, created prototypes, and completed each stage of the web application development process independently. I applied web development techniques to ensure the website was fully functional.

**Result:**  
I successfully developed a complete web application and gained experience in interface design, prototyping, and web development. I also improved my self-management, time management, problem-solving, and technical skills by completing this project independently.

### Reflection on Lessons Learnt Using STAR Method

**Situation:**  
During my WIL project, I started by coming up with a business idea and had to develop a web application independently. I faced tasks that required technical skills and problem-solving, such as designing interfaces, prototyping, and implementing the website.

**Task:**  
I needed to turn my business idea into a functional web application while learning and applying new technical and design skills. I also learned a new programming language, React, in order to build my project.

**Action:**  
I researched and refined my business idea, planned the web application, designed user-friendly interfaces, created prototypes, and implemented the website. I experimented with different design solutions, solved technical challenges, and applied web development techniques to ensure the application was functional and visually appealing for end-users.

**Result:**  
I successfully transformed my business idea into a working web application. I gained practical skills in interface design, prototyping, HTML, CSS, React, and web development. I also improved my problem-solving, time management, self-discipline, and gained confidence in managing and completing a project independently.
