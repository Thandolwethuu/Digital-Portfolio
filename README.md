#### Reflection on WIL Using STAR method
Situation:
During my WIL placement, I was assigned to a CPUT WIL project where I had to create a web application. I attended classes every day from Monday to Friday 8 AM to 4 PM and participated in daily stand-up meetings with the project manager.

Task:
My task was to design and develop a complete web application on my own, including creating interfaces, building prototypes and following all the steps required to make a functional website.

Action:
I attended the daily stand-up meetings, designed user-friendly interfaces, created prototypes and completed each stage of the web application development process independently. I applied web development techniques  to ensure the website was fully functional.

Result:
I successfully developed a complete web application and gained further experience in interface design, prototyping web development. I also improved my self-management,time management issues, problem-solving and technical skills through completing this project on my own.
