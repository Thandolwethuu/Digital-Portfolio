## Career Counseling

### Evidence

For the career counseling assessment, I do not have any evidence for it on my grade book because it was held on campus, where a personnel from the Career Counseling department came to give us tips and advice on how to structure our CVs and prepare ourselves for the working industry.

### Reflection
I found the career counselling session helpful and it provided helpul insigth.
- I learned how to effectively format my CV for various job opportunities.
- I realized the importance of modifying my CV to fit specific job descriptions.
- The session equipped me with enough confidence and knowledge needed to effectively prepare for entering the workforce.
